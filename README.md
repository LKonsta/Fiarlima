# Fiarlima

A simple web application for making Figure army lists aka Figure army list maker.

The database will consist of three tables for the army point listing and two tables for the making of the lists. The three army tables will be for army type, unit type and the last will be for the units themself. The two tables for making the army lists will consist a table for the making an army and a connecting table with the army making table and the unit type table.
