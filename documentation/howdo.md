## How to use

First what you want to do is create a new user in the top right corner

After or before you have created a new user, or if you are using this program for the first time what you want to do is press the Show army data link to generate some Demo data to use.

After a little load it should look something like this.

Now that you have some army data ready you can create a new army list. This you can do by clicking on the Add a list link.

Now we have a select field from where you choose for which army you want to make the list for.

(currently only beast herds has any units to choose from as it is the demo)

Then you can insert a name for you list. And last the amount of points you want your list to be.
In a normal game lists are around 3000-5000 points.

(currently there are no limits on points and no checks if the lists are legal point wise, so it doesn't matter)

Now we have created a base for an army list and can start editing the list.

As we can see the Beast Herds are split into 5 diffrent unit types: Characters, Core, Special, TotW and Ambush Predators.
From these you can choose diffrent units to add to them by clicking the Add new link under the unit type header.

For example if you choose to add a new unit under the special unit type you are brought to a view where there is a select field to select the unit you want to add and the amount of models within this unit.

In the Unit field there is a (for now) scuffed scale of how many models the unit starts with, to what is the maximum amount of models within one unit.
For example with the Feral hounds you start with 5 models and can choose upto 20 models.

Or Longhorn Herd you start with 10 and can choose up to 40.

<img src="https://github.com/LKonsta/Fiarlima/blob/master/documentation/howtouse_6.png" width="400">  

Or Briar Beast you start with 1 and that is the maximum.

(currently there are no checks to see if the amount is within the wanted values so it doesn't, matter what is putted there)

Now that you have choosen a unit to add it is shown in the army list editing page.
Now you have the ability to remove the unit or add new units.

If you press the Show all lists or Show my lists the list that have been created should be visible.

Now you can get back to editing your list by pressing the Show List button next to the list.

As you can see the earlier created 20 sized  Feral Hounds unit is still there.

Now you can continue editing until you are satisfied with the list you have.

Here is an example of what a final army list would look like.

(not taking consideration of the points that are not counted)
