# Use Cases

The database will consist of three tables for the army point listing and two tables for the making of the lists. The three army tables will be for army type, unit type and the last will be for the units themself. The two tables for making the army lists will consist a table for the making an army and a connecting table with the army making table and the unit type table.

The [database diagram](../master/documentation/Fiarlima.pdf) Shows these 8 tables and what they will consist of, in the future. These will most likely change futher along the project.

The goal is to be able to choose an army type and the max amount of points. Then have a list of avaliable unit types and under them you can choose the diffrent units and the amount of figures in them. After the forming of an army you can save it and, it shows if the army you made is valid with the games rules.

## Aftermath

All of these goals were fulfilled that I had planned to do for this project.

So basically if you know the rules for the game and know how to build a army list with the specific given data, you can.

But currently there are no list legality checks such as if an Character has 2 different mounts, or 2 weapons when it is specified that he can only have 1 of hte choices.

I am planning on expanding the program for it to have at least some of those functionalities, and also some other rule stuff that was left out such as magic items and banners.
